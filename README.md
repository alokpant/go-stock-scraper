## ðŸ“Š Example Output

**Console:**
```
Visiting https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT
Company: Microsoft Corporation, Price: 327.12, Change: +2.15
...
Scraping completed successfully.
Total stocks scraped: 12
```

**CSV (`stocks.csv`):**
| Company                 | Price   | Change |
|-------------------------|---------|--------|
| Microsoft Corporation   | 327.12  | +2.15  |
| Apple Inc.              | 172.05  | -1.23  |

---

## âš™ Customization
To change the list of tickers, modify the `ticker` slice in `main.go`:
```go
ticker := []string{"MSFT", "AAPL", "GOOGL"}
```

If Yahoo Finance changes its HTML structure, update the selectors in:
```go
c.OnHTML("#main-content-wrapper", func(e *colly.HTMLElement) { ... })
```

---

## âš  Notes
- Avoid sending too many requests too quickly â€” you may get blocked.
- The scraper relies on Yahoo Finance's HTML layout, which may change.
